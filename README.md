# AnS-kennel-cards
automatic kennel card generator for Found Animals Adopt and Shop animal rescue - see example PDF. Pulls animal information from ishelter databases and compiles into HTML then writes a PDF for printing.

Leorio.jpg (and any animal photos) should be in a photos directory: /photos/

Command line will prompt user for animal names (must be capitalized just like the photo names), but names not have a photo associated with them - will default to a generic image of cat/dog if no photos found.
